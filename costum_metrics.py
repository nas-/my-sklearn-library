    SMAPE Loss
    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
        Ground truth (correct) target values.
    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
        Estimated target values.
    Returns
    -------
    loss : float or ndarray of floats
        If multioutput is 'raw_values', then mean absolute error is returned
        for each output separately.
        If multioutput is 'uniform_average' or an ndarray of weights, then the
        weighted average of all output errors is returned.
        SMAPE output is non-negative floating point. The best value is 0.0.
